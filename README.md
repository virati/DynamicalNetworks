# HopfComputeNet

This is going to be the repo for the Hopf-Compute-Net, and attempt from me to merge emotion/mood metaphor into computation. I'm thinking this will merge into a Hopfield network where each node, isntead of a logistic, is a hopf system where the input biases the bifurcation constant, timing becomes important through the phase, etc.
